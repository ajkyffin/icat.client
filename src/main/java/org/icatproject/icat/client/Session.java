/**
 * A RESTful ICAT session.
 * <p>
 * The exportMetaData and ImportMetaData call make use of a special format to
 * represent ICAT data efficiently. The file may contain line starting with a #
 * sign. The first non-comment line contains the version number of the file
 * format with major and minor parts. Each entity type is preceded by a blank
 * line line followed by a one line entity descriptor and then a line for each
 * entity of that type.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * #  Version of file format
 * 1.0
 * 
 * Facility ( name:0, daysUntilRelease:1, createId:2, createTime:3)
 * "Test port facility", 90, "Zorro", 1920-05-16T16:58:26.12Z
 * 
 * InvestigationType (facility(name:0), name:1)
 * "Test port facility", "atype"
 * "Test port facility", "btype"
 * 
 * Investigation(facility(name:0), name:1, visitId:2, type(facility(name:0), name:3), title:4)
 * "Test port facility", "expt1", "one", "atype", "a title"
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The entity descriptor starts with the name of the entity type followed by a
 * comma separated list attribute of field names held inside parentheses. It is
 * not necessary to include those which you don't wish to set as any that are
 * not present and are allowed to be null will be set to null when importing. So
 * we see that this file will create a Facility with fields: name,
 * daysUntilRelease, createId and createTime. Following the field name is a
 * colon and an integer showing the offset to the data field in each of the next
 * set of rows. So a facility will be created with a name of
 * "Test port facility" and with 90 daysUntilRelease. All strings must be
 * enclosed in double quotes; to represent a a double quote within the string
 * then it must be escaped with a back slash: \". The following escape sequences
 * are available:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>\t : tab</li>
 * <li>\r : carriage return</li>
 * <li>\f : form feed</li>
 * <li>\b : bell</li>
 * <li>\n : new line</li>
 * <li>\" : "</li>
 * <li>\' : ' (Not really needed)</li>
 * <li>\\ : \</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * True, false and null literals are not case sensitive. The last two fields of
 * the facility are createId and createTime. If you specify that you want all
 * attributes and you are a "root user" then the values of createId and
 * createTime will be respected otherwise the current time is used and the id is
 * that of the user doing the import. Timestamp literals follow ISO 8601 and
 * support fractional seconds and time zones. If the time zone is omitted it is
 * interpreted as local time.
 * <p>
 * Now consider the InvestigationType for which we need to specify the facility
 * to which it belongs and its name. The facility cannot be described by its id
 * because we don't know what it is. So instead we list in parentheses the field
 * names that define it. So name:0 is the name of the facility and name:1 is the
 * name of the InvestigationType.
 * <p>
 * The next line shows the convenience of this syntax. The investigation has a
 * facility (identified by its name:0) and the name:1 of the investigation and
 * the visitId but it also has a type which is identified a facility (identified
 * by its name:0) and by the name:3 of the type. Finally it has a title:4 field.
 * Note that name:0 is used twice as in this case the investigation belongs to
 * the same facility as its type. This works fine as long as we deal with entity
 * types which have key fields. This is shown in the next snippet from an import
 * file:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * DataCollection(?:0)
 * "a"
 * "b"
 * "c"
 * 
 * DataCollectionDatafile(datafile(dataset(investigation(facility(name:0), name:1, visitId:2), name:3), name:4), dataCollection(?:5))
 * "Test port facility", "expt1", "one", "ds1", "df1",  "a"
 * "Test port facility", "expt1", "one", "ds1", "df2",  "b"
 * 
 * Job(application(facility(name:0), name:1, version:2), inputDataCollection(?:3), outputDataCollection(?:4))
 * "Test port facility", "aprog", "1.2.3", "a", "b"
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Here we have the DataCollection which we imagine to be identified by the
 * anonymous variable "?". This section of the file will create three
 * DataCollection entries which we shall remember for the duration of the import
 * process as "a", "b" and "c".
 * <p>
 * DataCollectionDatafiles are then associated with DataCollections "a" and "b"
 * and a job is created with one DataCollection as input and one as output.
 * <p>
 * When performing export the same format is used however some values will be
 * repeated - for example the facility name will appear many times in most rows.
